          <h3> Odd One Out Games – Blog #2 – Design Choices – Vote Collection</h3>
          <img src="img/SBB_LookAndFeel.jpg">

<p>Now that you’ve had a chance to get to know us a little bit, we wanted to start going through some of the design choices we made for Super Ballot Battle. Before we do that, let’s do a quick breakdown of our game!</p>

<p>Super Ballot Battle is a four-player objective based battle arena focusing on political humor. You will shout at voters around town in order to secure votes, shout at other candidates to spark debates and use pick-ups around town to sabotage other players while trying to become the next mayor of New Crestihill. You will take control of one of four unique characters.</p>









<p>- Joe Veal, the town’s alcohol enthusiast and loudest of the bunch. Normally too lazy to get involved, Joe’s concerns over the rising beer prices has got him up and fighting to bring cheaper beer to the people.</p>









<p>- Ana Conda, the biggest supporter of the night life in the town. She is a bit awkward at times but doesn’t care what people think of her. Ana is running in hope that the town can have more activities and festivals at night.</p>









<p>- Suzy Sheers, the popularity queen. Always wanting to be above everyone else, she decided nothing would make her more popular than winning an election and becoming mayor.</p>









<p>- Jeri Attrick, one of the oldest people in the town. It’s not every day you see someone as old as Jeri running for mayor, but with the town lacking health care, she’s competing to make sure she lives the longest life she can.</p>

<p>As mentioned in last week’s blog, as we looked back at the changes we made from initial concept to final design, one of the biggest evolution was our vote collection mechanic. We figured out pretty quickly that our game was going to be based around running around a town collecting votes to try and become the new mayor. Our final design choice was to have voters popping up all around town and players collecting those votes by shouting through their megaphones. After shouting at a voter, a quick time event (QTE) would put up and prompt the player to hit three buttons. If done successfully, they collect the vote! This was not our original concept.</p>

<p>Original Concept

<p>For our original concept, we had each player with a unique weapon that fit based on their name. (i.e Suzy had sheers, Ana Conda had a snake, etc). The players were able to hit each other to knock the other player back. Players would collect votes by standing in the “collection zone” in front of each voter until their meter fully filled. At this point, we were working with a much smaller map and only one or two voters popping up at a time to try and keep all the players together and battling through the game. We had an amazing opportunity to pitch this idea to a panel of industry professionals and we were encouraged to re-evaluate this design choice. They thought we had a good concept but we should really go all in on the political aspect of our game and that the melee combat and our current vote collection mechanic didn’t quite fit. This started us on the path towards what we have today.</p>

Transition From Melee








<p>We took the feedback from the panel and went into several more brainstorming sessions to try and flesh out a new voting mechanic that could replace it. We knew we wanted to keep the quick paced action that the melee combat was facilitating so we decided to increase the amount of voters on the board and make it quicker to capture votes. This led us away from having the collections zone and we needed a way to collect the votes quickly while still fitting the political theme. We decided on megaphones. We would have the players shout at voters to collect votes (much like real politicians!). This fit our theme, as well as provided a quick way for players to collect votes and move on. It gave us a way to still have the players interact with each other and they could still knock each other back by shouting at each other with the megaphone. We shopped this idea around and got mostly positive feedback but there was still a feeling that we were just missing something that tied it all together and made it more interesting.</p>

Final Design

<p>We again held several meetings to try and brainstorm ways to make our mechanic more interesting but the first pitch of our final design came when two of us were talking on the bus (you never know where inspiration will strike!). We were just throwing out random ideas for the game when one of us mentioned a quick time event after you shout at a voter. From there we built off the QTE idea, deciding that if you were able to capture a vote, another player would have a bit of time to try and steal that vote by shouting at the same voter and completing a more difficult quick time event. We realized we could push the political theme even more by having it so if the players shouted at each other it would spark a “debate” where both players would get a quick time event and the first one to complete it would win. We excitedly brought this back to the rest of who all jumped on board and together we discussed and finalized this mechanic. The feedback we got from this was very positive and we knew we had finally gotten to the mechanic we wanted to have.</p>

Next Week

<p>As we are coming up to our first major milestone in production, next week we will take a look at how our milestone went and the ups and downs of the production process so far.</p>
